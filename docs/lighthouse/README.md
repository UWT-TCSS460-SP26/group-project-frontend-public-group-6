## Top Issues & Fixes

### Performance

**1. LCP image not optimized (Details page) — Est. savings 28 KiB**
The main poster image (`w500` from TMDB) is served at 500×750 but displayed at 384×576, wasting ~28 KiB. It also lacks `fetchpriority="high"` and may have `loading="lazy"` applied, which delays LCP. Switching to Next.js `<Image>` with the `priority` prop and explicit `width`/`height` fixes all three issues at once (discovery, lazy-load, and sizing).
- Fix: Replaced `<img>` with `next/image` `<Image>` in `app/movie/[id]/page.tsx` and `app/tv/[id]/page.tsx`; added `priority`, `width={500}`, `height={750}`; whitelisted `image.tmdb.org` in `next.config.ts`
- Status: ✅ Fixed

**2. Non-composited animations (both pages)**
Animations running on CSS properties the GPU can't composite force the browser to repaint on every frame, causing jank and contributing to CLS.
- `span.btn-shine` (home) — `left` property animated; replaced with `transform: translateX()` + `skewX()` in `globals.css`; `left: 0` is now a fixed base position
- `a.btn-primary.btn-marquee` (home) — `box-shadow` animated; refactoring would significantly alter the visual design; documented as known limitation
- `span.logo-icon` (both) — `filter` animation (`logoGlow`); refactoring would significantly alter the visual design; documented as known limitation
- Status: ✅ Fixed (`btn-shine`); ⚠️ Accepted (`box-shadow`, `filter` — design trade-off)

**3. Render-blocking CSS (both pages)**
A Next.js-generated CSS chunk (`0tqu6u.jv3wux.css`, 12.3 KiB) blocks the page's initial render on every page load, directly delaying FCP and LCP. The browser must fully download and parse it before painting anything.
- Fix: Add `experimental.optimizeCss` in `next.config` or audit which styles are critical and inline them; alternatively accept this as a Next.js build artifact and document it as a known limitation
- Status: ☐ Not yet fixed

### Accessibility

**1. Color contrast — Home page (`.genre-chip`, `.feature-col__copy`)**
Genre chip links and feature section body text fail WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 required). Text is too close in color to its background.
- Fix: Updated `--text-muted` token from `#7a6a50` to `#b8a88a` in `globals.css` (~7.6:1 contrast ratio, up from ~3.5:1)
- Status: ✅ Fixed

**2. Color contrast — Details page (`.tagline`, `.meta-label`, `.community-count`, `.review-card__date`)**
Multiple elements on the detail panel fail contrast: the tagline, metadata labels, community rating count, and review dates are all too low-contrast against their backgrounds.
- Fix: All elements use `--text-muted` or `--muted` (which maps to `--text-muted`), so the same token change in fix #1 resolved all of these automatically
- Status: ✅ Fixed

**3. Incompatible ARIA roles — `.genre-chip` (Home page)**
`<a>` elements had `role="listitem"` which overrides the anchor's native link role and confuses screen readers.
- Fix: Replaced `<div role="list">` / `<Link role="listitem">` with semantic `<ul>/<li>` HTML in `app/page.tsx`; no ARIA role overrides needed
- Status: ✅ Fixed
